title: Disclosure Interaction
description: The DisclosureInteraction component is an interactive button that expands into a small sheet when clicked. The sheet provides six options (e.g., Project, Task, Note, etc.), and includes a close button to collapse the sheet back to its original state. It features smooth animations for expanding and collapsing, and is styled with Tailwind CSS and lucide-react icons.
