title: Disclosure Interaction
description: The DisclosureInteraction component is an interactive button that expands into a small sheet when clicked. This sheet provides six options (e.g., Project, Task, Note, etc.) and includes a close button to collapse the sheet back to its original state. The component features smooth animations for expanding and collapsing, and is styled using a clean and modern UI design.
